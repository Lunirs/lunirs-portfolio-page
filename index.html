            Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Daniel and I am currently
            studying to become a web developer! I originally studied biomedical
            engineering and graduated from the University of Illinois at
            Urbana-Champaign. I was exposed to some coding during my time at the
            university and it really stood out. Once I realized that biomedical
            engineering was not for me, I tried to expose myself to different
            areas in industry. I worked for a dental implant manufacturing for a
            year and a half in the marketing department. However, I decided to
            explore coding and I am thoroughly enjoying every bit of it.
          
          <p>
            I like to play games, read, play sports (tennis), and play the
            piano! Hopefully you appreciate the meme gif on my banner as much as
            I did when I first saw it :). Thank you for visiting my page! If you
            would like to view my projects or contact me, please see below
